# Dash interactive python plotting
This repository is used to create simple webapp using `python` and `dash`. All 
the examples are collected from this [link](https://dash.plot.ly/)

* It's good to use `dash` to create some simple visualization of your data to get more clarity and relation of
different predictors among themselves.
* After getting a new datasets, it will be always good to create such simple visualizer (if possible interactive)
  which will bring lots of clarity to your work.
